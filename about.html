<h1>About Us:</h1>
<blockquote> 
Car.ma is nothing like a well-known little blue book for used car values.  We serve big data fast.  
<p></p>
We do not ask for your zip code, and we do not provide different prices for the same car depending on whether you are the buyer (retail) or the seller (trade-in).  
 
<p></p>
That is dishonest, We serve 
<h3>One car, One Price.</h3>
<p></p>
 
<p></p>
<br>
Our  "Market Price" is based upon actual transactions in the wholesale market (35 million per year/100,000 per day), and reveals the information most dealerships would prefer not to disclose.  
<p></p>
Enjoy...Learn... and return the Karma to auto dealerships.

<h1>Team:</h1>
<blockquote> 
Car.ma was built by two guys from the financial derivatives space who have a passion for democratizing data; <br>
We want to pry information from the reigns of the priviledged few and unleash it upon the masses.
